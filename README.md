# Books Analysis and Recommendation System
# Anamika Jha


#### The datafile for books contains 278,858 users (anonymized but with demographic information) providing 1,149,780 ratings (explicit / implicit) about 271,379 books. It has not been uploaded as its a huge file. However, it can be found on Kaggle.
#### We will analyse this data to check which authour's book our users prefer to read the most, where are they from, what rating is given to the books and more.
#### The other books_rating dataset which is uploaded is used for Recommendation System.
#### A recommendation system seeks to predict the rating or preference a user would give to an item given his old item ratings or preferences. Recommendation systems are used by pretty much every major company in order to enhance the quality of their services.
#### The Project has EDA, Data Visualization and a Recommendation System based on K Nearest Neighbour.
#### Hope you like it :)
